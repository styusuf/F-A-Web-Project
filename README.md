F-A-Web-Project
===============

This is a project for the University of Georgia Finance and Administration department. The project will update the department's website and add a CMS functionality that makes adding and updating content easier for clients. The CMS to be used is Drupal.

To better manage the web project, I decided to get a Github account. Now I'm learning how to use this website and its functionalities.
